## Application Overview

This software aims to improve the management of product purchases within a company to optimize the total profits that are expected within a fiscal period. To achieve this, the program will allow the users to: 

* Submit a valid readable file labelled, **_readFile_**, containing the completed company data for the stored products during the previous fiscal time period. 
* Check the data file through the command line, with the choice of adding/removing or modifying chosen product data.
* Run and with the final completed data to determine the chosen items for restocking based on a **Ranked List** policy.
* View the final decision of the algorithm for what which products had been selected for restocking and how many of those products where selected.
